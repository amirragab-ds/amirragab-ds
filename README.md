I am a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I have helped companies make data-driven decisions that reduced costs, optimized workflows, and solved problems. 

Some examples include:

Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning - Water industry: 
 
I implemented predictive maintenance using machine learning in water filtration pipes for a water filtration and delivery company, reducing maintenance costs by an estimated 20-30%. I achieved this by conducting data analysis, recommending tailored machine learning models, and implementing refined sensor data optimizations, adjusted data collection frequency, and enhanced maintenance scheduling. The result is a more efficient and cost-effective system.

Deep Learning Curriculum for a Company Course:

I developed a 120-hour structured deep learning curriculum for a company course, guiding learners from foundational neural networks to advanced topics like CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and transformers. Through 3 hands-on projects in image classification, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition, learners achieved practical mastery with real datasets. Proficiency in TensorFlow, a prominent deep learning framework, rounded out their skill set, ensuring a seamless transition to impactful real-world applications.
